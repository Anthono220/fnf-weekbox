# FNF: Weekbox
 
Welcome one and all to **FNF Weekbox**, a mod pretty much made by one person (me, Anthono220) for base game (V-slice) FNF! This will be a traditional, 3-song-per-week kind of deal featuring a wide variety of opponents, most of which aren't mine lol

I don't know how else to describe it tbh

## Instructions
NOTE: This mod is for 0.5.2 and the version requirement will only go up as both the mod and the base game get updated.

If there isn't a "mods" folder where your game is, make that first. Then, extract the zip (which should contain a folder) to the mods folder and you should be good to go.

## Weeks so far
### Pico
1: "GUNS N' AXES" | VS. Eteled (Wii Deleted You)
